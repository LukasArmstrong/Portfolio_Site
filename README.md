# Portfolio_Site

Hello! Welcome to my repo for the personal portfolio site. Currently this site is under heavy development and is largely baren. Once the skeleton structure of the site has been figured out, styling, and then scripting.

## Things to work on:
- Finish Skeletonal Structure ✅
- Setup basic styling
- Add banner warning about under development ✅
- Setup hosting on personal server
- Add resume through html elements instead of embedding pdf ✅
- Finsish Styling
- Start adding previous projects under subdomains
- Easter Eggs?
